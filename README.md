### What I learned

During this project I  had to work with an image that had 2 files depending on the screen size. I found this challenging to work out with my searches pointing me towards using an srcset within an <img> tag. This solution seemed odd and I struggled to get it to work how I wanted. Eventually I found a better method using <picure> with a <source> and <img> embedded inside. I found this to be a cleaner and simpler method.

### Continued development

I expermented with using gap within a flexbox to evenly space elements and utilised grid to evenly arrange two sections on desktop. I'd like to better understand and use grid and flex box to simplify spacing and formatting in this way.
